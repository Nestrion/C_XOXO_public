# A tic-tac-toe game

The game was written in C, using the SDL library.
The AI was implemented with the minimax algorithm; ergo, you can't win.

Click tiles to place marks.
Esc - brings up the start/restart button
There is no dedicated exit button, the only way to close the program is to press the 'x' in top right corner.
